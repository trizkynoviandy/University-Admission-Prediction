# University Admission Prediction

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a student being admitted to a university based on various factors. We used a sample dataset of 400 student records, and employs four different machine learning methods to make the predictions: linear regression, random forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and a voting regressor that combines the predictions of the first three methods.

## Requirements
In order to run the script, you will need to have the following packages installed:

* NumPy
* Pandas
* scikit-learn

## Disclaimer
This script is provided for educational purposes only, and is not intended to be used for making actual admissions decisions. The predictions made by the script should not be taken as definitive, and should always be considered in conjunction with other factors such as the student's personal statement, letters of recommendation, and the overall admissions criteria of the university.
